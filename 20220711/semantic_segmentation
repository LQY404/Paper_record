comment: classes are not arranged in a “flat” structure, but organized as a tree-shaped hierarchy. Thus each pixel observation is associated to a root-to-leaf path of
the class hierarchy. solve the semantic segmentation task in graph view, like our idea in CAD segmentation task, formulate the segmentation task as graph clustering task.
