comment: classes are not arranged in a “flat” structure, but organized as a tree-shaped hierarchy. Thus each pixel observation is associated to a root-to-leaf path of
the class hierarchy. solve the semantic segmentation task in graph view, like our idea in CAD segmentation task, formulate the segmentation task as graph clustering task.

comment: use fix size pre-defined instance center features represent all instance center this input image. the modeling method is very like the Sparse R-CNN, the difference is, Sparse R-CNN pre-defined the instance features instead of instance center features.

comment: this method is similarity with our idea in CAD, so we should read and understand this work very careful.
